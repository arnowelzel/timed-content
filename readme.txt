Plugin to show or hide portions of a Page or Post at a specified time after loading. 

== Description ==

The Timed Page/Post Content plugin allows users to specify that a portion of a Page or Post should appear/be visible or
disappear/be invisible based on given time characteristics.  The plugin provides two functions:

* A "client-side" shortcode that allows the marking of content to appear or disappear after a given time interval; a "fade" 
effect is included.  This functionality is intended to be used for special effects only, as content marked in this manner 
is still visible in the HTML source and, therefore, not a secure method of hiding content.
* A "server-side" shortcode that allows the marking of content to be visible only during a specified date/time interval.  This 
functionality **can** be used as a secure method of hiding content, because the marked content will be included in the Page/Post 
**only** when viewed in the specified date/time interval.

A TinyMCE button is included to help users build the shortcodes.
