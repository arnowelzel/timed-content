Plugin to show or hide portions of a Page or Post based on specific date/time characteristics.

== Description ==
The Timed Content plugin allows users to specify that a portion of a Page or Post should appear/be visible or
disappear/be invisible based on given time characteristics. Suppose, for example, you embed a video into a Post; once the viewer has enough information 
from the video, the request to take a specific action can be set to appear.  You can also make portions of a Post or Page be visible at certain dates and
times; you can even set up a schedule!

The plugin adds the following:

* A "client-side" shortcode that allows the marking of content to appear or disappear after a given time interval; a "fade" 
effect is included.  This functionality is intended to be used for special effects only, as content marked in this manner 
is still visible in the HTML source and, therefore, not a secure method of hiding content.
* Two "server-side" shortcodes that allow the marking of content to be visible only during specified date/time intervals.  This
functionality **can** be used as a secure method of hiding content, because the marked content will be included in the Page/Post 
**only** when viewed in the specified date/time intervals.

A TinyMCE dialog is included to help users build the shortcodes. See the Screenshots tab for more info.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

No "frequent" questions as of yet, but come ask away in the Support forum.

== Screenshots ==

1. An example showing use of the `[timed-content-client]` shortcode.  The "alarm clock" button on the editor menubar brings up a
dialog box to help build the Timed Content shortcodes. All of the Admin-side screenshots are from Wordpress 3.7, but the functionality
is the same for 3.8.
2. The "Add Timed Content shortcode" dialog showing the Client tab.  Check the attribute you want to add and fill in the textboxes.
3. The "Add Timed Content shortcode" dialog showing the Server tab.  Check the attribute you want to add, then click on the Date and Time textboxes.
4. The date and time pickers help you format a correct date and time.  Here's the jQuery UI Datepicker in action.
5. The "Add Timed Content shortcode" dialog showing the Timed Content Rules tab.
6. You can use both shortcodes together and with other shortcodes supported by your Wordpress installation.
7. The Timed Content Rules overview page.  Timed Content Rules allow you to set up a schedule for showing/hiding your content.
8. Editing a Timed Content Rule.  Here, you can see the jQuery UI Timepicker in action.
9. Check the Scheduled Dates/Times to verify when your rule will be active.
10. An example showing use of the `[timed-content-server]` shortcode with `debug` set to `true`. You'll only see it if you're logged in and it's on a Page/Post you can edit (Your regular visitors won't see this at all).

== Examples ==

`[timed-content-client show="1:00"]Show me after one minute.  Since we don't want a fade-in, we can leave it out of the "show" attribute completely.[/timed-content-client]`

`[timed-content-client show="1:00:1000"]Show me after one minute with a 1000 millisecond (1 second) fade-in.[/timed-content-client]`

`[timed-content-client show="1:00:500" hide="5:00:2000"]Show me after one minute with a 500 millisecond (a half-second) fade-in, then hide me after five minutes with a 2000 millisecond (2 seconds) fade-out.[/timed-content-client]`

`[timed-content-server show="2013-Sep-13 20:30:00 -0600"]Show me starting at 8:30 PM Central Standard Time on September 13th, 2013. I will not be displayed before then.[/timed-content-server]`

`[timed-content-server hide="2013-Sep-13 20:30:00 America/Chicago"]Hide me starting at 8:30 PM Central Daylight Time (i.e., the same timezone as Chicago) on September 13th, 2013.  I will not be displayed after then[/timed-content-server]`

== Usage ==

NOTE: All shortcodes can be built using the TinyMCE dialog.  When in doubt, use the dialog to create correctly formed shortcodes.

**The timed-content-client shortcode**

`[timed-content-client show="mm:ss:fff" hide="mm:ss:fff"]Example Text[/timed-content-client]`

* `show` - Specifies the time interval after loading the web page when the marked content should be displayed. The attribute consists of three parts,
separated by colons: `mm` - minutes, `ss` - seconds, and `fff` - if greater than `0`, a fade-in effect lasting `fff` milliseconds is applied.
* `hide` - Specifies the time interval after loading the web page when the marked content should be hidden. The attribute consists of three parts,
separated by colons: `mm` - minutes, `ss` - seconds, and `fff` - if greater than `0`, a fade-out effect lasting `fff` milliseconds is applied.

Both attributes are optional, but at least one attribute must be included. Leading zeros (0) are optional. The shortcode's behaviour depends on which attributes are used:

* `show` only - Marked content is initially not visible, then appears `mm` minutes and `ss` seconds after loading with a `fff` millisecond fade-in.
* `hide` only - Marked content is initially visible, then disappears `mm` minutes and `ss` seconds after loading with a `fff` millisecond fade-out.
* `show` and `hide` - Marked content is initially not visible, then appears according to the values set in `show`, then disappears according to the values set in `hide`.

Your users must have JavaScript enabled for this shortcode to work.

**The timed-content-server shortcode**

`[timed-content-server show="datetime" hide="datetime" debug="true|false"]Example Text[/timed-content-server]`

* `show` - Specifies the date/time when the marked content should start being included on the web page. The attribute consists of `datetime` - a human-readable date/time description. The plugin uses PHP's <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php">strtotime</a> function to process dates/times, so anything it can understand can be used.
* `hide` - Specifies the date/time after which the marked content should stop being included on the web page. The attribute consists of `datetime` - a human-readable date/time description. The plugin uses PHP's <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php">strtotime</a> function to process dates/times, so anything it can understand can be used.
* `debug` - If `true`, adds some debugging statements to the web page as HTML comments. Defaults to `false`.

Both `show` and `hide` attributes are optional, but at least one attribute must be included. The shortcode's behaviour depends on which attributes are used:

* `show` only - Marked content is outputted only after the date/time set here.
* `hide` only - Marked content is outputted only before the date/time set here.
* `show` and `hide` - Marked content is outputted only during the time period defined by the `show` and `hide` attributes.

**The timed-content-rule shortcode**

`[timed-content-rule id="{rule_id}|{rule_name}"]Example Text[/timed-content-rule]`

You can find the correct shortcode from the Timed Content Rules overview page, or use the TinyMCE dialog.

**Action hooks**

`add_action( "timed_content_server_show", "{function_name}", {priority_level}, 4 );`

Fired when the `[timed-content-server]` shortcode is encountered *AND* the content is to be displayed based on the shortcode's show/hide attributes.  Functions using this hook should accept the following arguments in order:

* `$post_id` - the ID of the currently displayed Post/Page
* `$show` - the value of the `show` attribute. If not set, defaults to "1970-Jan-01 00:00:00 +000"
* `$hide` - the value of the `hide` attribute. If not set, defaults to "2038-Jan-19 03:14:07 +000"
* `$content` - The content enclosed by the shortcode

`add_action( "timed_content_server_hide", "{function_name}", {priority_level}, 4 );`

* `$post_id` - the ID of the currently displayed Post/Page
* `$rule_id` - the ID of the Timed Content Rule being called. Use `get_post_meta( $rule_id )` to get the Rule's properties.
* `$content` - The content enclosed by the shortcode

`add_action( "timed_content_rule_hide", "{function_name}", {priority_level}, 3 );`

* `$content` - The content enclosed by the shortcode

**Filter hooks**

`timed_content_filter`

Filter for any content enclosed by a Timed Content shortcode.  Implements the same filters as `the_content`:

* `wptexturize`
* `convert_smilies`
* `convert_chars`
* `wpautop`
* `prepend_attachment`
* `do_shortcode`

`timed_content_filter_override`

Replaces the `timed_content_filter` with another pre-existing filter to use for any content enclosed by a Timed Content shortcode.  Any function hooked into this filter must return the name of a filter (as a string).
